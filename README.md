# Peach_purees
This notebook analyzes 50 samples containing peach puree.
For each peach puree, the absorption in the NIR was measured and the BRIX value, which correlates strongly with the sugar content, was determined.
The aim is to predict the BRIX value from the NIR spectrum using variance reduction.

The data was not collected by me, but only evaluated.
